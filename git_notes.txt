Pull Requests are how you merge branches on GitHub

GitHub is a hub of .git/ directories

You can push and pull commits to and from .git/ directories

You can also clone .git/ directories to new computers or new paths

master branch is a label that git creates for us when we initialize a repository

HEAD is another label that git creates for us when we create our first commit

HEAD is *not* a branch

# creates a new branch (label) called git-notes
git branch git-notes

# shows us which branch is active
git branch
